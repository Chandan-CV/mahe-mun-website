        Manipal Academy of Higher Education is here with the inaugural edition of MAHE MUN to create a legacy of its own by making an elegant entry into the world of conferences with uncountable exciting elements. MAHE MUN is going to be the ideal conjunction of spirited debates with global & analytical perspectives, teachable moments, fun interactions and delegates from around the world. With professionals of immense experience in the sphere of MUNs, we also give the participants an important learning opportunity to merge the multitude of opinions they come across in the eventful two days of the conference. 
This will truly be a one-of-a-kind experience with a formal conference, a DJ, amazing food and countless other fun activities at a breathtaking campus: a combination that perhaps has never been encountered before. 
Mark your calendars, 7th and 8th October. We look forward to hosting you!
